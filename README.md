More details:

Imagine yourself desperately wanting to reach somebody by phone but there is no answer, either because the person is sleeping, simply forgot to turn the ringer tone on, or can't hear it because ring volume is too low. You would keep calling and calling — depending on how important reaching this person is for you. If it's important, you would've call many times in a matter of minutes.


Urgent Call Filter smartly recognizes this kind of situation, and enables audible ringtone for the incoming call it deems urgent, based on the preferences. You may want to be fairly easily reachable while asleep, or you may want only very, very important calls to disturb you from your peaceful activities.


Sideline use: Find your misplaced phone even if it's silent.
Ring yourself a few times, and the phone will announce itself by producing a ringtone.


In order to test app functionality, ask your friend to give you a few calls.
