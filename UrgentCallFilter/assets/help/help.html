            How does it work?</div>
        <div class="textbody">
	        <p>
	        Imagine yourself desperately wanting to reach somebody by phone but there is no answer, either because the person
	        is sleeping, simply forgot to turn the ringtone on, or can't hear it because the ring volume is too low.
	        You would keep calling and calling — depending on the importance of the call.
	        If it's important, you would've call many times in a matter of minutes.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        <strong>Emergency Call Filter</strong> smartly recognizes this situations, and will allow the call to ring audibly or boost it's volume
            if it's considered important.
	        </p>
	        <p>
            The importance of the call is judged based on your preferences.
            You may want to be fairly easily reachable while asleep, or you may only want very important calls to disturb you from your peaceful activities.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        The app does so without using system resources, and without running in the background all the time.
	        Thus it is very reliable, and one of the <em>set-it-and-forget-it</em> kind of applications.
	        </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Note: By default, app only works in <em>Silent</em> mode (ringer turned off) — out of <em>Silent</em> mode, it will do nothing.
                This can be changed by preference.

            Filter levels</div>
        <div class="textbody">
	        <p>
            To learn how the filter level affects your availability to calls, let's consider some examples.
	        </p>
	        <p>
            Let's say your filter level is set to the default level 2.2, and an incoming call is just about to happen.
	        </p>
	        <p>
            To find out whether this call will be allowed to ring audibly, we must consider the calls received in the last several minutes.
            We must take into account whether this caller has already called, during what time interval, how many times, and the ratio
            of cumulative ring duration to the time interval in question.
	        </p>
	        <p>
            Let's consider three simplified example scenarios:
   	        </p>

            <ol>
            <li><strong>Person <em>A</em> already called you one time in the last two minutes prior to this call, and was ringing for 90 seconds.</strong>
	        <p>
            <em>Ring interval ratio</em>, or the ratio of total cumulative ring time versus the whole time interval observed, for person A is:
	        </p>
            <div class="equation">(1 call * 90 second ring) / (2 * 60 seconds) = 75%.</div>
	        <p>
            The call that's just about to happen <strong>will not be allowed to ring audibly</strong>,
            because the person called <strong>only 1 time</strong> prior to this call, and our filter levels' minimum is set to 2 calls.
            The interval ratio is high indeed, but the ratio alone is not enough to trigger audible ring.
	        </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Person <em>B</em> already called you two times in the last five minutes prior to this call, each time ringing for 30 seconds.</strong>
	        <p>
            Ring interval ratio for person B:
	        </p>
            <div class="equation">(2 calls * 30 second rings) / (5 * 60 seconds) = 20%.</div>
	        <p>
            The call that's just about to happen <strong>will not be allowed to ring audibly</strong>,
            because the <strong>interval ratio is less than 30%</strong>, which is a minimum for the default filter level.
	        </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Person <em>C</em> already called you two times in the last five minutes prior to this call, each time ringing for a whole minute.</strong>
	        <p>
            Ring interval ratio for person C:
	        </p>
            <div class="equation">(2 calls * 60 second rings) / (5 * 60 seconds) = 40%.</div>
	        <p>
            The call that's just about to happen <strong>will be allowed to ring audibly</strong>,
            because the person already called <strong>2 times</strong> prior to this call,
            and the <strong>interval ratio for these two calls is more than 30%</strong>, which is a minimum for the default filter level.
	        </p>
            </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
            If a person calls you more times than is required by the filter level,
            only the minimal required amount of most recent calls is taken into consideration, the rest is ignored.
            For example, if a person called you 5 times and the filter level is 2.2,
            only the last 2 calls are considered when calculating the ring interval ratio and deciding whether to allow the ring to become audible.
            </p>
            <p id="tables">
            Effects of filter levels with some more examples are summarized in the tables below.
            Green is for the call that is allowed to ring audibly, red is when it's not allowed.

	        General rule says, of course, that it's more difficult for a caller to reach you if the filter level is set higher.

	        By default, app will do it's magic only when the phone is in <em>Silent</em> mode, ie. ringtone turned off.
	        </p>
	        <p>
            This can be changed by preference to also include <em>Vibrate</em> and <em>Sound</em> modes.

	        <p>
	        When in <em>Sound</em> mode, the app will behave a bit differently.
            Since the ringer is already turned on, it will instead boost the important call ring volume to 100%,

                This app is intended for people who often set their phones to <em>Silent</em> mode (ie. turn the ringer tone off),
                or turn the ringer volume way down — for example while sleeping — yet still want to be reachable for important situations.
	        </p>
	        <p>
               It's not intended for those who use <em>Silent</em> mode only when in meetings, lectures or similar <em>do-not-disturb</em> situations
               of relatively <strong>short duration</strong>, where unattended ringtone escalation would cause inconvenience.
