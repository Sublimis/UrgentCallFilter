	        Imagine yourself desperately wanting to reach somebody by phone but there is no answer, either because the person
	        is sleeping, simply forgot to turn the ringer tone on, or can't hear it because ring volume is too low.
	        You would keep calling and calling — depending on how important reaching this person is for you.
	        If it's important, you would've call many times in a matter of minutes.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        <strong>Urgent Call Filter</strong> smartly recognizes this kind of situations, and enables audible ringtone (or boosts it's volume)
            for the incoming call that's considered important, based on your preferences. You may want to be fairly easily reachable while asleep, or you
	        may want only very, very important calls to disturb you from your peaceful activities.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        It does so without using system resources, and without running in the background all the time.
	        Thus it is very reliable, and one of <em>set-it-and-forget-it</em> kind of applications.
	        </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Note: By default, app only works in <em>Silent</em> mode (ringer turned off) — out of <em>Silent</em> mode, it will do nothing.
                This can be changed by preference.

                This app is intended for people who often set their phones to <em>Silent</em> mode (ie. turn the ringer tone off),
                or turn the ringer volume way down — for example while sleeping — yet still want to be reachable for important situations.
	        </p>
	        <p>
               It's not intended for those who use <em>Silent</em> mode only when in meetings, lectures or similar <em>do-not-disturb</em> situations
               of <strong>short duration</strong>, where unattended ringtone escalation would cause inconvenience.

            What is call intensity?</div>
        <div class="textbody">
	        <p>
	        <em>Call intensity</em> is the number of rings in a (short) time period.
	        </p>
	        <p>
            As an example, consider person <em>A</em> that calls you three times in five minutes,
            and person <em>B</em> that calls you six times in five minutes.
            We say that calls from person <em>B</em> are more <em>intensive</em> in this case.
            Person <em>C</em>, who would call six times in 10 minutes, would have the same call intensity as person <em>A</em>.

            <h3 id="levels">Intensity levels</h3>
	        <p>
	        <strong>Low (1/4)</strong><br />Incoming call ring will be audible only if the <strong>last 1 call</strong> had enough persistence.<br />
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        <strong>Medium (2/4)</strong><br />Incoming call ring will be audible only if the <strong>last 2 calls</strong> had enough persistence.<br />
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        <strong>High (3/4)</strong><br />Incoming call ring will be audible only if the <strong>last 3 calls</strong> had enough persistence.<br />
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        <strong>Extreme (4/4)</strong><br />Incoming call ring will be audible only if the <strong>last 4 calls</strong> had enough persistence.<br />
	        </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Note: By default, app does nothing when phone is not in <em>Silent</em> mode. This can be changed by preference.</strong>

            What is call persistence?</div>
        <div class="textbody">
	        <p>
	        <em>Call persistence</em> is the density of rings over a (short) time period, taking ring duration into account.
	        </p>
	        <p>
            As an example, consider person <em>A</em> that calls you three times in five minutes, each time ringing for 20 seconds,
            and person <em>B</em> that calls you three times in five minutes, but each time ringing for a whole minute.
            We say that calls from person <em>B</em> are more <em>persistent</em> in this case.
            Person <em>C</em>, who would call six times in five minutes by ringing for 10 seconds each time, would have the same call persistence
            as person <em>A</em>.

    <div class="paragraph" id="ringermodes">
        <div class="subtitle">
            Applicable ringer modes</div>
        <div class="textbody">
	        <p>
	        By default, app will do it's magic only when the ringer is in <em>Silent</em> mode, ie. ringtone turned off.
	        </p>
	        <p>
            This can be changed by preference to also include <em>Vibrate</em> and <em>Sound</em> modes, or a combination of modes.
            It can also be set to work in any mode — <em>Silent</em>, <em>Vibrate</em>, and <em>Sound</em>.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        When in <em>Sound</em> mode, app will behave a bit different than normal.
            Since the ringer is already turned on (and there's no point of turning it on again),
            app will instead boost the ringtone volume of important call to 100%.
	        </p>
	        <p>
            <strong>Important thing to remember here is that the volume of important call will always be boosted to the maximum
            when app is set to work in <em>Sound</em> mode and the phone is indeed in <em>Sound</em> mode,
            regardless of the <em>Volume</em> setting.</strong>
	        </p>
	        <p>
            This is useful when ringtone is not loud enough for the person to hear it, for example in noisy environments,
            or when the phone is in the other room, etc.
